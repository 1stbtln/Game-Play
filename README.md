# GamePlay  

GamePlay is a desktop application built with Electron to help gamers and content creators create real-time highlight montages of their gameplay. The app algorithmically edits automatically captured clips in real-time, allowing users to quickly play back customized highlight reels.

## Features (Planned)  
- Automatic clip detection and OCR validation.
- Algorithmically edits clips into highlight montages.  
- Allows users to customize edit preferences (Music, Transitions, Filters etc.)
- Function offline using local resources for network priority.  
- Real-time processing to deliver a complete video within seconds.  

## Status  
This project is currently in development. While the core features are not ready yet, the groundwork is being laid for further testing. 

## License
