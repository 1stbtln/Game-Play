# GamePlay

GamePlay is a desktop application built with **Electron** that automates the process of creating highlight montages for **PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS**. By integrating with **OBS Studio's replay buffer**, GamePlay captures in-game moments, applies basic video edits, and allows users to customize their final montage before sharing it. Designed for streamers and content creators, the app ensures fast, efficient, and high-quality highlight generation.

## ROI (Region of Interest) Detection

GamePlay uses **Tesseract.js**, an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library, to extract and analyze in-game text for identifying highlight-worthy moments. **Regions of Interest (ROIs)** are extracted from the screen to determine key events, such as kills and headshots.

### **Kill Notification Example**

## **Session Tracking & Clip Management**

GamePlay dynamically assigns **session IDs** to track which clips belong to which game session. This is essential for:
- Preventing clips from different matches from being combined incorrectly.
- Ensuring that clips are grouped together in the correct order when creating a montage.
- Allowing users to retrieve past session clips if needed.

### **How Session Tracking Works**
1. When a new game starts, **GamePlay generates a unique session ID**.
2. Every recorded clip from that session is **tagged with the session ID**.
3. At the end of the game, all clips with the same session ID are **concatenated into a highlight montage**.
4. If the session ID changes (indicating a new game), a **new set of clips is stored separately**, preventing overlap.

This **automated tracking system** ensures that each game's clips remain grouped together while allowing users to switch between different game sessions if needed.
